# Notebooks Repository
---

## Overview

This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization methods. Each notebook focuses on a specific concept, algorithm, or project, providing explanations, code examples, and hands-on exercises to help you deepen your understanding and build practical skills.

## Contents

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Notebooks exploring techniques for data exploration, visualization, and understanding dataset characteristics.
- **Supervised Learning**: Notebooks covering supervised learning algorithms such as regression, classification, and ensemble methods.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Notebooks demonstrating unsupervised learning techniques including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
- **Model Evaluation and Validation**: Notebooks discussing methods for evaluating and validating machine learning models, including cross-validation, performance metrics, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Projects**: Notebooks showcasing end-to-end machine learning projects, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.
